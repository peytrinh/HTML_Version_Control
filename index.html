    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a student learning Interactive Design. This is where I show some of the work I did in class.</p>
    
    <!-- Showcase -->
    <h2>My Work</h2>

    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div>
        <h3>Peach Logo</h3>
        <p>This is one of the first logos I designed using my nickname.</p>
        <img src="Pictures/Logo_Coloured.png" alt="Coloured Logo saying 'Peach'." style="width: 50%;" />
    </div>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div>
        <h3>Heavy On It Logo</h3>
        <p>This is the most recent logo I designed for my class. This is for the record label "Heavy On It" who has yet to have their own official logo.</p>
        <img src="Pictures/HeavyOnIt_Logo.png" alt="Heavy On It Logo" style="width: 50%;" />
    </div>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <div>
        <h3>Wild Home Photoshop</h3>
        <p>This is a photoshop project where we had to use images online to design a 'Wild' home.</p>
